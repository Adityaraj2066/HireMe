# HireMe – Backend Application (Java + Spring Boot)

## 📌 Overview
HireMe is a backend application built using **Java and Spring Boot** that demonstrates real-world backend development practices such as layered architecture, RESTful APIs, and database integration.

This project focuses on **clean code, scalability, and proper API flow**, similar to production-ready backend systems.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Java  
- Spring Boot  
- REST APIs  
- Spring Data JPA / Hibernate  
- MySQL  
- Maven  
- Postman (API Testing)

---

## ✨ Features
- User registration and data persistence  
- RESTful API design using proper HTTP methods  
- Layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository)  
- Business logic separation  
- Database interaction using JPA  
- Exception handling and validation  

---

## 🏗 Architecture
- **Controller Layer** – Handles client requests and responses  
- **Service Layer** – Contains business logic  
- **Repository Layer** – Manages database operations  
- **Entity Layer** – Maps Java objects to database tables  

This structure improves maintainability and scalability.

## ⚙️ Application Flow
1. Client sends an API request  
2. Controller receives the request  
3. Service processes business logic  
4. Repository interacts with the database  
5. Response is returned to the client
